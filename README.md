### Collatz Conjecture

Inspired by a great video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)

This is just a project to sharpen my thinking skills and how I would implement my type of Collatz Conjecture. I did that on recursion and appended all the numbers
to a list, where I used them in the graph. You're free to use the code as you like!
