### Collatz Conjecture

Inspired by a great video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg)

This is just a project to sharpen my thinking skills and how I would implement my type of Collatz Conjecture. Firstly, I thought about recursion, then I used while loop to get all numbers into a list, then I used Model-View-Control design pattern. You're free to use the code as you like!
